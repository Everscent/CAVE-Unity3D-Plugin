INSTALLATION:

- Just drag the CAVE folder into an existing Unity3D project.

PREPARING YOUR CAVE:

  1. In the nVidia control panel, create a custom resolution that is one pixel 
     less in both width and height than your desired resolution. (On our CAVE,
     it is 2799x1049)

  2. Under Screen Resolution, change layout to Extend This Display instead of 
     Duplicate This Display.

  3. When you launch your game, the custom resolution should be listed in the 
     options. Select it and run the game windowed.

SETUP:

  -Killing Window Borders
    
    1. Drop a NoWindowBorder script anywhere in the first scene that loads. 
       NOTE: DO NOT LEAVE THIS SCRIPT ENABLED WHEN TESTING IN THE UNITY EDITOR.

    2. Set the variables on the NoWindowBorder script.
          - X & Y: Should always be 0.
          - Width & Height: Set desired width and height, on ours its 2800x1050.

  -3D CAVE Camera
  
    1. Drop a CAVE Camera prefab into the scene.

    2. Treat this CAVE Camera like you would any other camera object.

    3. Only change the child cameras if you need to edit Skyboxes/GUI Layers/etc.

    4. Finally, drop a 3D Viewer prefab into the scene somewhere out of the way.

  -CAVE Multi-Screen Networking

    1. Create a new scene to act as your menu.

    2. Add a NetworkManagerScript somewhere in your scene.

    3. Create a new script that inherits from NetworkDisplay.

    4. Overload the ClientCamInit() method and add code to destroy your scripts that 
       handle user input, then call base.ClientCamInit().

    5. Add one of these new NetworkDisplay scripts to the scene and then add a 
       reference too it in the editor to the NetworkManagerScript.

    6. Fill out the other necessary attributes for NetworkManagerScript:
          - SceneToLoad: String name of the scene you want to load that is equipped 
            with a CAVE Camera.
         
          - IP: This should be the ip of the screen acting as the server (Usually 
            the center screen).
          
          - Port: Generally, you can just keep this at 25000 and be fine.
          
          - Connections: Max number of connections to server, make sure this is at 
            least as large as the number of screens in your CAVE setup.
          
          - Use NAT: This should pretty much always be disabled, since there most 
            likely isn't a router between your CAVE computers.
          
          - Use Master Server: Again, this should be pretty much always be disabled 
            since you are probably on a LAN.
          
          - Server Name & Server Description: These are only used for registering 
            with the Master Server, so you can probably ignore them.
